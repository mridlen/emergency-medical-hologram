# emergency-medical-hologram
Emergency Medical Hologram - a tool for decoding FTP Voyager configuration files (*.Archive files) into an XML like format.
This does not output strict XML, but it should be enough for export purposes.

It doesn't modify them into anything usable by any program, but it may help you along in your quest.

Usage:

1) Add execute permission "chmod +x parse_voyager.sh"

2) "./parse_voyager.sh <filename>.Archive"
